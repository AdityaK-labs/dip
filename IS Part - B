1. Explain the process of Risk Management in identifying, assessing and controlling risks in an organization's information system. (15 Marks)
Introduction
Risk Management is the formal process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks that threaten an organization’s information assets.
Its goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability while supporting business continuity.
According to notes, Risk Management consists of three major phases:

Risk Identification

Risk Assessment

Risk Control

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


I. Risk Identification
Risk Identification begins by examining and documenting the organization’s information assets and their vulnerabilities.
It answers: “What do we need to protect?”

Steps:
1. Inventorying Information Assets
Identify all assets:

People, Procedures, Data

Software, Hardware, Networks
Each asset is documented with details like owner, location, serial no., IP, version, value etc.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


2. Classifying Assets
Assets are classified based on sensitivity:

Confidential

Internal

Public
(Or military: Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, SBU).

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


3. Prioritizing Assets
Questions used:

Which asset is most critical?

Which generates more revenue?

Which is most expensive to replace?

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


4. Identifying Threats
Threat sources include:

Human error

Espionage

Theft

Software failure

Natural disasters

Obsolescence

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


5. Identifying Vulnerabilities
List all weaknesses that can expose each asset.
Example:
DMZ Router → DoS vulnerability, ISP failure, routing software bug.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


Outcome:
A Vulnerability Assessment Report.

II. Risk Assessment
Risk Assessment assigns a risk rating to each identified vulnerability.
It answers: “How bad is each risk?”

1. Asset Valuation
Assign value according to business importance.
Example: Customer database = value 100.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


2. Likelihood Determination
Probability that a vulnerability may be exploited.
NIST scale:

0.1 = Low

1.0 = High

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


3. Risk Calculation Formula
Risk = (Likelihood × Value) – (Current Controls) + Uncertainty
Example (from notes):
Value = 50, Likelihood = 1.0
Risk = 55

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


4. Documenting Risk Levels
A ranked vulnerability risk worksheet is produced.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


III. Risk Control
Risk Control selects and applies safeguards to reduce risk to acceptable levels.
It answers: “What will we do about each risk?”

Risk Control Strategies:
Avoidance

Transference

Mitigation

Acceptance

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


Each strategy uses policies, education/training, and technologies.

Case Study – Online Retail Company
Identified asset: Customer Order Database (value = 100).

Threat: DoS attack.

Vulnerability: No firewall, single webserver.

Likelihood: 0.8

Controls chosen:

Avoidance → Install firewall + IDS

Mitigation → Backup system + DRP

Transference → Host website on cloud provider

Conclusion
Risk Management is a continuous lifecycle involving the identification of assets, assessment of threats, and application of appropriate controls. It ensures business continuity and protects organizational assets against evolving threats.

2. Explain in detail about Risk Control Strategies and the procedure for selecting the Risk Control Strategy. (15 Marks)
Introduction
Risk control involves applying safeguards to reduce risk to the information assets.
Risk controls fall under 4 major strategies: Avoidance, Transference, Mitigation, and Acceptance.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


I. Risk Control Strategies
1. Avoidance
Prevents exploitation by:

Applying policies

Training and awareness

Using security technologies (firewalls, encryption)

Examples:

Disable unused ports

Enforce password policies

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


2. Transference
Shift risk to external entities.
Methods:

Outsourcing

Insurance

Service contracts

Cloud hosting services

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


3. Mitigation
Reduce impact during an attack.
Includes:

a. Incident Response Plan (IRP)
What to do when incident is in progress.

b. Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Actions to restore systems after disaster.

c. Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
Long-term continuity even after catastrophic failure.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


4. Acceptance
Organization chooses to do nothing.
Used when:

Cost of protection > expected loss

Low likelihood

Low impact

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


II. Procedure for Selecting Risk Control Strategy
1. Evaluate Threat Level and Asset Value
High-value assets → Avoidance or mitigation.
Low-value → Acceptance sometimes allowed.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


2. Feasibility Studies
Study feasibility for each control:

Economic Feasibility: cost–benefit

Technical Feasibility: is tech available?

Operational Feasibility: can org support it?

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


3. Determine Attacker Cost vs. Defender Cost
If attacker cost < defender loss → apply stronger control.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


4. Layered Security Approach
Combine more than one strategy:

Avoidance + Mitigation

Transference + Mitigation

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


5. Residual Risk Evaluation
Residual risk = risk remaining after controls.
Strategy must reduce residual risk to acceptable level.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


Rules of Thumb (from Notes)
When vulnerability exists → implement controls

When it can be exploited → apply layered protections

When potential loss is high → strong controls

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


Case Study – Data Center
Threat: Power failure
Vulnerability: No backup power
Strategies selected:

Avoidance → Surge protectors

Mitigation → UPS + generator

Transference → Insurance
Residual risk became acceptable.

Conclusion
Effective risk control strategy selection requires evaluating risk level, feasibility, attacker motivation, and cost. It ensures proper protection for each asset.

Steps:
A. Create vulnerability list for each asset
Examples:

Router → DoS vulnerability

Database → weak access control

Server → outdated OS version

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


B. Group discussions and iterative analysis
Teams conduct multiple sessions to identify all vulnerabilities.

C. Map threats to vulnerabilities
Example from notes:
DMZ router vulnerable to both deliberate software attacks and power supply failure.

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


Final Output of Risk Identification
You get three documents:

Asset Inventory List

Threat List

Vulnerability List
These form the basis for risk assessment.

Case Study – University Information System
Asset: Student database
Threat: Unauthorized access
Vulnerability: Weak passwords
Identification steps:

Classified database as confidential

Valued as 95/100

Identified SQL injection vulnerability

Prepared vulnerability report → basis for control strategy.

Conclusion
Risk Identification is foundational to the entire Risk Management process.
Without proper identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, an organization cannot assess risks or apply effective controls.

 where applicable, plus required cryptography expansions.

1. Analyze the concept of cryptography and its importance in securing communications. Compare symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques with real-world examples. (15 Marks)
Introduction
Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable form so that only authorized users can access it.
It ensures four fundamental security services:

Confidentiality – keeping data secret

Integrity – preventing unauthorized modification

Authentication – verifying identities

Non-repudiation – preventing denial of actions

5 OEC503 INFORMATION SECURITY N…


Cryptography is crucial in modern communication systems such as banking, e-commerce, email, cloud storage, VPNs, and military communication.

Concept of Cryptography
Cryptography uses mathematical algorithms and keys to convert plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data).

Basic operations:
Encryption – Plaintext → Ciphertext

Decryption – Ciphertext → Plaintext

Key – Secret value used in encryption/decryption

Cipher – The algorithm (AES, DES, RSA, etc.)

Types of cryptography
Symmetric key cryptography

Asymmetric key cryptography

Hash functions

Importance of Cryptography in Securing Communications
1. Protects Data Confidentiality
Only authorized entities can read the message.
Example: Secure messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal) use encryption.

2. Ensures Data Integrity
Cryptographic hash functions ensure data has not been changed during transmission.

3. Provides Authentication
Digital signatures and certificates verify identity.

4. Enables Secure E-Commerce
Online banking, UPI transactions, and credit card payments use TLS/SSL encryption.

5. Prevents Eavesdropping & Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
Attackers cannot read or modify encrypted traffic.

6. Essential for National Security
Governments and military rely on cryptography to protect classified data.

Comparison: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption
Feature	Symmetric Encryption	Asymmetric Encryption
Keys Used	Single key (same for encryption & decryption)	Two keys – Public key (encrypt), Private key (decrypt)
Speed	Fast & efficient	Slow due to complex maths
Key Distribution	Problematic (must share key secretly)	Secure key sharing (public key can be openly distributed)
Best Use Case	Encrypting large data volumes	Securely exchanging keys, digital signatures
Algorithms	AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish	RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman
Security Level	Strong but depends on key secrecy	Very strong due to mathematical hardness (factorization/elliptic curves)
Real-World Use Cases
Symmetric Encryption (Examples)
1. AES encryption in Wi-Fi security
WPA2/WPA3 use AES for fast bulk encryption of wireless communication.

2. Disk Encryption
BitLocker and FileVault use AES to encrypt entire hard drives.

3. Payment Systems
Credit card data is encrypted using symmetric keys before transmission.

Asymmetric Encryption (Examples)
1. SSL/TLS Handshake
Websites use:

Browser encrypts data with server’s public key (RSA/ECC)

Server decrypts using private key
Used in HTTPS (e.g., banks, Amazon, Gmail).

2. Digital Signatures
Used in Aadhaar authentication, PAN systems, e-filing.
Ensures integrity + origin authenticity.

3. Cryptocurrencies
Bitcoin and Ethereum use public key cryptography (ECC) to verify ownership of coins.

How Symmetric and Asymmetric Work Together (Hybrid Encryption)
Modern systems use both:

Asymmetric (RSA/ECC) → To securely exchange a symmetric AES session key

Symmetric (AES) → To encrypt the actual data

Used in:

SSL/TLS

WhatsApp end-to-end encryption

Cloud storage services

Conclusion
Cryptography is the backbone of secure communication.
Symmetric encryption is fast for bulk data, while asymmetric encryption solves the key distribution problem. Modern systems combine both to achieve optimal security and performance.
