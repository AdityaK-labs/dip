Here are perfect 2-mark answers—short, clear, exam-ready, and in 4–5 lines each.

⸻

1. State IDPS and List the types of IDPS.

IDPS stands for Intrusion Detection and Prevention System, which monitors network/system activities to detect and block attacks.
It identifies suspicious behavior and responds automatically.
Types include Network-based IDPS (NIDPS), Host-based IDPS (HIDPS), Wireless IDPS, and Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) systems.

⸻

2. Show the use of scanning and analysis tools.

Scanning and analysis tools are used to identify vulnerabilities, open ports, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in systems or networks.
They help in risk assessment, security audits, and penetration testing.
Example tools: Nmap (port scan), Nessus (vulnerability scan), Wireshark (packet analysis).

⸻

3. Define cryptography.

Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable form using mathematical algorithms.
Only authorized users with the key can convert it back to plaintext.
It provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.
Example: AES, RSA.

⸻

4. Show the advantages of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

IDS helps in early detection of attacks and unauthorized activities.
It improves system security by alerting suspicious events in real-time.
It identifies policy violations, malware, and abnormal behavior.
Example: Detecting port scans or brute-force attempts.

⸻

5. What are firewalls? Quote the different types of Firewalls.

Firewalls are security devices that filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on rules.
They act as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
Types include Packet Filtering, Stateful Inspection, Application Proxy, and Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW).
Example: Blocking unwanted IP addresses.

⸻

6. What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?

PKI is a framework that manages public-key encryption, digital certificates, and authentication.
It enables secure communication over insecure networks.
It includes Certificate Authorities (CA), Registration Authorities (RA), and key management systems.
Example: SSL certificates used in HTTPS websites.

⸻

7. What are access control devices?

Access control devices are tools used to regulate who can access systems, networks, or physical areas.
They enforce authentication and authorization.
Examples: Smart card readers, biometric scanners, keypad locks, access control software, and role-based access systems.

⸻

8. Categorize IDPS detection methods.

IDPS detection methods include:
	1.	Signature-based detection – matches known attack patterns.
	2.	Anomaly-based detection – detects deviations from normal behavior.
	3.	Stateful protocol analysis – checks protocol behavior for violations.
These methods help identify different types of intrusions effectively.

⸻

9. What are Honeypots and Honeynets?

A Honeypot is a decoy system designed to lure attackers and study their behavior.
A Honeynet is a collection of multiple honeypots connected together.
They help in analyzing attack methods and improving network defenses.
Example: Fake vulnerable servers used for research.

⸻

10. Define a Padded Cell System.

A padded cell system is a security mechanism where an intruder is silently transferred to a simulated environment after detection.
The attacker believes they are accessing a real system, but all actions are monitored.
It prevents damage while collecting evidence.
Example: Redirecting a hacker to a fake server with no real data.
