4. Assess the Defense-in-Depth policy.

Defense-in-depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of protection so that if one layer fails, others still protect the system.
Layers include physical, network, host, application, and data security.
It reduces the chance of complete system compromise.
Example: Firewall + IDS + antivirus + access control.

⸻

5. Define Issue-Specific Security Policy (ISSP).

ISSP is a policy that addresses specific areas of technology or specific issues such as email use, internet access, or password rules.

The major strategies are Avoidance, Mitigation, Transference, Acceptance, and Deterrence.
Avoidance removes the risk completely, while mitigation reduces its impact.
Transference shifts risk to third parties (e.g., insurance).
Acceptance means living with low risks; deterrence prevents attacks through warnings and penalties.

The main components of an information system are Hardware, Software, Data, People, and Processes/Procedures.
Hardware includes devices like computers; software includes applications and OS.
Data refers to raw facts, like customer records.
People include users, admins, managers, etc., and procedures define how tasks must be performed.

⸻

2. List out the measures to protect the confidentiality of information.

Confidentiality can be protected through encryption, strong authentication, access controls, and data classification.
Using passwords, biometrics, and role-based access prevents unauthorized access.
Encrypted emails and VPNs protect information during transmission.
Example: Protecting patient records using AES encryption.

⸻

3. What are the functions of Locks and Keys?

Locks and keys provide physical security by preventing unauthorized access to restricted areas like server rooms.
They help secure hardware assets and sensitive documents.
Keys ensure only authorized personnel can access protected zones.
Example: A data center with biometric locks and key-card access.

⸻

4. Identify the importance of a C.I.A triangle.

The C.I.A triangle stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, forming the foundation of information security.
It ensures information is protected from unauthorized access (C), remains accurate (I), and is accessible when needed (A).
Balancing these three ensures secure and smooth operations.
Example: Banking systems protect account data using CIA principles.

⸻

5. Define Information Security.

Information Security refers to the practice of protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, and destruction.
It aims to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

These qualities ensure information is correct, usable, and protected.
Example: Only authorized staff can modify payroll data (integrity + authenticity).

⸻

7. What is NSTISSC security model?

The NSTISSC Model (National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee) is a framework describing security objectives, information states, and security countermeasures.
It consists of 3 dimensions: Information states (storage, processing, transmission), Security goals (CIA), and Safeguards (policy, technology, education).
It helps design complete security systems.

⸻

8. What are the multiple layers of security to be present in an organization?

The layers include Physical security, Network security, Host/Operating System security, Application security, Data security, and Policy/Procedural security.
Using layered security ensures that if one layer fails, others still protect the system.
Example: Firewalls (network) + CCTV (physical) + access control (data).

⸻

9. Comment on “Balancing information security and access”.

Security must be strong, but not so strict that it prevents authorized users from accessing information.
Too much security slows productivity; too little leads to risks.
A balance is maintained using role-based access and least privilege principles.
Example: Employees can access only the data required for their job.

⸻

10. What are the 2 approaches in implementing information security?

The two approaches are Top-down and Bottom-up.
Top-down is led by senior management and includes policies, funding, and security structure—more effective.
Bottom-up is driven by technical staff but often lacks authority and support.
Example: A company adopting ISO 27001 using a top-down approach.
